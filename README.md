# SysTrayUploaderFile

**A lightweight file uploader that runs silently from your system tray on Windows 10/11.**

SysTrayUploaderFile is designed for quick and convenient file uploads, integrating seamlessly into your Windows environment. It requires a specific backend server (`server.jar`) and a MongoDB database to function.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get SysTrayUploaderFile up and running on your system.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* **Visual Studio 2022 or later:** With the **.NET Desktop Development and WFP** workload installed.

* **.NET SDK 8/9:** The runtime and development tools for .NET applications.

* **Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 17:** Required to run the `server.jar` backend.

* **MongoDB Instance:** A running MongoDB database (either local or a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas).

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    Start by cloning the project to your local machine:

    ```
    git clone [https://github.com/naconmizu/SysTrayUploaderFile.git](https://github.com/naconmzi/SysTrayUploaderFile.git)
    cd SysTrayUploaderFile](https://github.com/naconmizu/SysTrayUploaderFile.git)

    ```

2.  **Build the Application:**

    * Open `App.sln` in **Visual Studio**.

    * Ensure the **build configuration** is set to `Release` (not Debug).

    * Press `F5` to build and run the application. This will compile the client application.

3.  **Set Up the Backend Server:**
    The application relies on a Java-based backend.

    * **Create a server directory:** Create a folder named `server` in your user directory:

        ```
        C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\server

        ```

    * **Place `server.jar`:** Move or copy the `server.jar` file into this newly created `C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\server` folder.
        *(If you don't have `server.jar`, you can clone the backend repository and build it yourself.)*

4.  **Configure MongoDB Connection:**
    The application requires a MongoDB database connection. You **must** set the `MONGO_URI` environment variable on your system.

    * **MongoDB Atlas (Cloud Example):**

        ```
        setx MONGO_URI "mongodb+srv://user:password@cluster0.mongodb.net/your-database"

        ```

    * **Local MongoDB Example:**

        ```
        setx MONGO_URI "mongodb://localhost:27017/DB"

        ```

    * **Important:** After setting this variable, you'll need to **restart your system** or **reopen Visual Studio** for the changes to take effect across your environment.



## ðŸ’¡ Troubleshooting Tips

* **Firewall Issues:** If you're encountering connectivity problems, ensure your **firewall allows connections** to your backend server, especially if `server.jar` isn't running on the same machine as the client or if external access is needed.

* **`MONGO_URI` Not Detected:** Double-check that the `MONGO_URI` environment variable is set correctly and that you've restarted your system or Visual Studio after setting it. Incorrect variable names or typos are common culprits.

* **Testing `server.jar` Independently:** To verify your backend server is working, you can run it directly from your command line:

    ```
    java -jar C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\server\server.jar

    ```

    This helps isolate whether the issue is with the backend or the client application.
